# ref-type
First full-stack project

Used this amazing repository https://github.com/gionathas/speed-typing to set up the base typing game logic (I'm not very good with React). It is heavily modified to fit my needs, but I give massive credit for being my starting point.

# immediate-concerns
1. Cannot set time (15s/60s is what i want)

# to-be-done
1. Store user info (userID, best15, best60)
   - Ensure that user info is only stored if a user is logged in
2. Display leaderboard (top 100 in 15s, top 100 in 60s)
